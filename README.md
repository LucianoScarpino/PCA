# PCA APPLICATION

This project is part of the Computational Linear Algebra course at Politecnico di Torino, academic year 2024/2025. It focuses on applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to real-world tabular data for dimensionality reduction and exploratory analysis.
---
## Objective
The goal was to implement and interpret PCA on a dataset containing high-dimensional responses to survey-style questions. The project includes:
	- Data preprocessing and cleaning
	- Manual implementation of PCA using linear algebra concepts
	- Comparison with sklearnâ€™s PCA module
	- Visualization of principal components and explained variance
	- Interpretation of the results in terms of data structure and meaning

***Skills Demonstrated***
	- Linear algebra in data science (eigenvectors, covariance matrices)
	- Dimensionality reduction techniques
	- Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
	- Jupyter Notebooks for scientific reporting

***Files***
	- HWpca_Scarpino.ipynb: Main notebook containing the full analysis and code
	- columns_hw.csv: Column metadata (likely question labels)
	- responses_hw.csv: Dataset with survey responses
